# create_quadrilateral
An addon I developed for blender that mirrors 2 edges with a common vertex to create a quadrilateral

#to install

download the python script and install manually through the blender UI.
edit > preferences > addons > install > select file

#instructions for use

the operator works only when you have exactly 2 edges selected.

The 2 edges must also share a common vertex.

The tools panel only shows up in EDIT mode so make sure you are in EDIT mode.

If you cant see the sidepanels press N to reveal them while in 3D layout.

The panel will be under tools in the sidebar.

With 2 edges selected press the button that says form quadrilateral.

The common vertex will be mirrored and 2 extra edges will be added creating a quadrilateral shape.

#about

I developed this addon to help me fix some issues with my mesh.

The effect can easily be achieved manually but the addon saves quite a few clicks.

I had never developed an addon for a program before so it was a nice exercise.
